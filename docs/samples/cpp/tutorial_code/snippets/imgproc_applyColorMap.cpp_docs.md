## Original Source Code

The following is the complete source code of this file:

```
#include <opencv2/core.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgproc.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui.hpp>
using namespace cv;

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
    // We need an input image. (can be grayscale or color)
    if (argc < 2)
    {
        cerr << "We need an image to process here. Please run: colorMap [path_to_image]" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
    Mat img_in = imread(argv[1]);
    if(img_in.empty())
    {
        cerr << "Sample image (" << argv[1] << ") is empty. Please adjust your path, so it points to a valid input image!" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
    // Holds the colormap version of the image:
    Mat img_color;
    // Apply the colormap:
    applyColorMap(img_in, img_color, COLORMAP_JET);
    // Show the result:
    imshow("colorMap", img_color);
    waitKey(0);
    return 0;
}
```
