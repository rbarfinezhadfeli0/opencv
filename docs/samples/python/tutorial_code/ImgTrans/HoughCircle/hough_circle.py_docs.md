def main(argv):
    ## [load]
    default_file = 'smarties.png'
    filename = argv[0] if len(argv) > 0 else default_file

    # Loads an image
    src = cv.imread(cv.samples.findFile(filename), cv.IMREAD_COLOR)

    # Check if image is loaded fine
    if src is None:
        print ('Error opening image!')
        print ('Usage: hough_circle.py [image_name -- default ' + default_file + '] \n')
        return -1
    ## [load]

    ## [convert_to_gray]
    # Convert it to gray
    gray = cv.cvtColor(src, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    ## [convert_to_gray]

    ## [reduce_noise]
    # Reduce the noise to avoid false circle detection
    gray = cv.medianBlur(gray, 5)
    ## [reduce_noise]

    ## [houghcircles]
    rows = gray.shape[0]
    circles = cv.HoughCircles(gray, cv.HOUGH_GRADIENT, 1, rows / 8,

            cv.circle(src, center, 1, (0, 100, 100), 3)
            # circle outline
            radius = i[2]
            cv.circle(src, center, radius, (255, 0, 255), 3)
    ## [draw]

    ## [display]
    cv.imshow("detected circles", src)
    cv.waitKey(0)
