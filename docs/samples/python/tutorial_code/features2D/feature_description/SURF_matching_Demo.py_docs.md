## Purpose and Role

This file is located in the `samples/python/tutorial_code/features2D/feature_description` directory and serves as part of the OpenCV library infrastructure.

## Original Source Code

The following is the complete source code of this file:

```
from __future__ import print_function
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Code for Feature Detection tutorial.')
parser.add_argument('--input1', help='Path to input image 1.', default='box.png')
parser.add_argument('--input2', help='Path to input image 2.', default='box_in_scene.png')
args = parser.parse_args()

img1 = cv.imread(cv.samples.findFile(args.input1), cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
img2 = cv.imread(cv.samples.findFile(args.input2), cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
if img1 is None or img2 is None:
    print('Could not open or find the images!')
    exit(0)

#-- Step 1: Detect the keypoints using SURF Detector, compute the descriptors
minHessian = 400
detector = cv.xfeatures2d_SURF.create(hessianThreshold=minHessian)
keypoints1, descriptors1 = detector.detectAndCompute(img1, None)
keypoints2, descriptors2 = detector.detectAndCompute(img2, None)

#-- Step 2: Matching descriptor vectors with a brute force matcher
# Since SURF is a floating-point descriptor NORM_L2 is used
matcher = cv.DescriptorMatcher_create(cv.DescriptorMatcher_BRUTEFORCE)
matches = matcher.match(descriptors1, descriptors2)

#-- Draw matches
img_matches = np.empty((max(img1.shape[0], img2.shape[0]), img1.shape[1]+img2.shape[1], 3), dtype=np.uint8)
cv.drawMatches(img1, keypoints1, img2, keypoints2, matches, img_matches)

#-- Show detected matches
cv.imshow('Matches', img_matches)

cv.waitKey()
```
